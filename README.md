GitHub Activity Fetcher is a easy to use portable excecutable wich allows a user to fetch information from another users with GitHub's REST API.
Just enter a username an identifier and thats it!
Optionally, one can filter repo specific and enter an access token.

The informations you obtain are:
* User Events (can now be saved inside a json file)
* Your Rate Limit
* Remaining Requests
* Rate Limit Reset time

IF THERE ARE ANY ISSUES WITH THE PROGRAM, TELL ME!

> Note: This is an early version. More updates may come in the future!
