This API fetcher was made to fetch simple user activity by first entering a username then an app name or identifier, optionally repo specific with an access token.

The informations you obtain are:
* User Events
* Your Rate Limit
* Remaining Requests
* Rate Limit Reset time

IF THERE ARE ANY ISSUES WITH THE PROGRAM, TELL ME!

> Note: This is an early version. More updates may come in the future!
