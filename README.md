This API fetcher was made to fetch simple user activity by first entering a username then an app name or identifier, optionally repo specific with an access token.

The results are User Events, Rate Limit, Remaining Requests and Rate Limit Reset time.

IF THERE ARE ANY ISSUES WITH THE PROGRAM, TELL ME!
